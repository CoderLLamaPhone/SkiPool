4. Application Name: SkiPool

5. Application Description:
SkiPool is a ride-sharing app designed to make winter mountain trips more affordable, accessible, and environmentally friendly while fostering a strong, inclusive community of outdoor enthusiasts. 
SkiPool accomplishes this mission by connecting riders looking for transportation with drivers already heading to the mountains. This helps users of SkiPool save on common travel expenses by sharing 
costs such as gas, parking, and tolls. This not only makes winter adventures more budget-friendly but also reduces the environmental impact of individual trips and opens up access to users who might not 
own or have access to their own transportation.

The website allows passengers to filter by ski resorts, ski pass type, or price and allows ratings for both drivers and passengers. The website allows the user to create a post as a driver or sign up as 
a passenger to another driver's posts. When creating a post as a driver, the user can specify the date of travel, the price they want from each passenger, the number of passengers they can bring, and the ski resort they are going to. When signing up as a passenger, the user must specify the address they want to be picked up from and their phone number in order to coordinate the pickup time with the driver.

Beyond cost savings, SkiPool aims to build a strong community in a space that has commonly lacked inclusivity by keeping expenses high. The website encourages positive interactions by allowing users to 
rate and review each other, promoting trust and accountability among members, especially when they're going on a trip with someone they haven't met before. By rewarding reliable and respectful 
participants and discouraging those who do not contribute positively to the community, SkiPool ensures a safer and more enjoyable way for everyone to access the mountains together.

6. Target Audience: 
Skiers and snowboarders who don't have a ride to the ski resorts or have extra space in their car. More specifically, this website targets college students, as many college students do not have cars and 
still want to go skiing.

7. Vision Statement:
For college students who want to ski/snowboard, who don't have a ride or have extra space in their car. SkiPool is a website that matches passengers with drivers to promote carpooling. 
Unlike Uber, SkiPool is targeted towards college students who need a ride to the slopes!

8. Version Control: Repository is set up accordingly

9. Development Methodology:
Using Trello to keep track of the progress of the project.
